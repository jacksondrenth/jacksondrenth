### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jackson Drenth, a current Sophomore graduating in 3 years, May 2025 at Creighton University as a FinTech and BIA: IT Track Major. I'm currently in the process of bettering myself and starting projects that will both push what I learn and show my skills. I am currently working on learning TensorFlow and using that create better ML algorithms for fun side projects.
